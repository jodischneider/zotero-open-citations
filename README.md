# Open Citations Plugin for Zotero

This Zotero plugin adds information about open citations data for one or several items in Zotero.
Currently, a DOI lookup in the [OpenCitations COCI service](https://w3id.org/oc/index/coci) is implemented, the result is added as a note, and the latest references are saved in a special collection in Zotero:
